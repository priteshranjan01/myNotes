Creating a application security threat model.

1. What guarantees would you like to give your customers regarding the application's security, and what expectations will they have?
2. In what environment do you expect the application to be used?
3. How do you expect the features of the application to be used?

Model step:
  Document application-relevant security concerns. From these models understand specific threats that the application must defend against.
  Develop diagrams (eg. Data Flow Diagrams) which portray significant components of the application from a security perspective.
  Draw 1. Processes 2. Data Flows 3. Data Stores 4. External Entity 5. Trust Boundaries

  S - Spoofing
  T - Tampering
  R - Repudiation
  I - Information Disclosure
  D - Denial of Service
  E - Elevation of privilege.

After identifying the threats, determine the necessary conditions that would turn them into successful attacks. Threat trees is very successful in this.

Identify applicable standard thread mitigations.
Spoofing - Authentication, PKI, TLS, IPSec, MACs, Digital signatures, Hashes.
Tampering Identity - ACLs, MACs, Digital signatures.
Repudiation - Strong authentication, security logging and auditing.
Information disclosure and confidentiality: Encryption, ACLs
Denial of service - ACLs, Filtering, Quotas, Authorization, High Availability design
Elevation of privilege - Authorization - ACLs, privilege ownership, permissions, input validation.
