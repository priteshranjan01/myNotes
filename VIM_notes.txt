VIM Search and replace : http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Search_and_replace

Basic search and replace:
	:%s/foo/bar/g		Find each occurrence of 'foo' (in all lines), and replace it with 'bar'.
	:s/foo/bar/g		Find each occurrence of 'foo' (in the current line only), and replace it with 'bar'.
	:%s/foo/bar/gc		Change each 'foo' to 'bar', but ask for confirmation first.
	:%s/\<foo\>/bar/gc	Change only whole words exactly matching 'foo' to 'bar'; ask for confirmation.
	:%s/foo/bar/gci		Change each 'foo' (case insensitive due to the i flag) to 'bar'; ask for confirmation.
	:%s/foo/bar/gcI		Change each 'foo' (case sensitive due to the I flag) to 'bar'; ask for confirmation.
	:5,12s/foo/bar/g	Change each 'foo' to 'bar' for all lines from line 5 to line 12 (inclusive).

To comment out blocks in vim:
	press Esc (to leave editing or other mode)
	hit ctrl+v (visual block mode)
	use the up/down arrow keys to select lines you want (it won't highlight everything - it's OK!)
	Shift+i (capital I)
	insert the text you want, i.e. '% '
	press Esc
	Give it a second to work.

	To uncomment blocks in vim:
	press Esc (to leave editing or other mode)
	hit ctrl+v (visual block mode)
	use the up/down arrow keys to select the lines to uncomment.
	If you want to select multiple characters, use one or combine these methods:

	use the left/right arrow keys to select more text
	to select chunks of text use shift + left/right arrow key
	you can repeatedly push the delete keys below, like a regular delete button
	press d or x to delete characters, repeatedly if necessary

	press Esc

    Give it a second to work.

While editing a file with VIM, these command do their regular jobs.
:pwd  :cd

:e foo.c  --> Open foo.c
:e #      --> Return to the previously opened file.
:ls       --> Display the list of opened files in current VIM session
:bd <number> --> Close the file represented by number got from :ls
]]        --> Skip multiple functions fast. Use [[ to browse backwards.
:se list  --> Check which whitespaces are tabs. Whatever displayed as ^I in blue are tabs.
:se hlsearch -> TO highlight searches
:se nohlsearch -> To turn off highlighting



%  --> Place cursor on brace/ or #if block and % shall take you to the matching brace.

gg=G  --> typing this in command mode indents the whole file.
:help indent.txt  --> learn more about indenting.
If ctags is enabled then, Ctrl-N or Crl-P does auto completion and possible hints.

Multiple files in different tabs in VIM-7
:tabe <file-name>  --> Open a file in new tab.
:tabn or :tabp to switch active tab.
Map keys <F7> to :tabp and <F8> to :tabn, write the below two lines in .vimrc file
:map <F7> :tabp<CR>
:map <F8> :tabn<CR>

BOOKMARK cursor position:
Go to some line you want to bookmark by :22 and enter mb in command mode.
b is the name of line number 22. You can navigate to 22 by simple typing 'b
in command mode. (single quote + <mark name>)
---------------
Selecting a text

V       - selects entire lines
v       - selects range of text
ctrl-v  - selects columns
gv      - reselect block

After selecting the text, try d to delete, or y to copy, or :s/match/replace/, or :center, or !sort, or...

u -> undo
CTRL + r -> redo

-----------------------------------------
Text folding:
:set foldmethod=indent -> Nicely indents code blocks.
zj and zk move the cursor to next and previous folds.
At the cursor,
za (toggle), zc (close), zo (open)  : One level of folding
zA (toggle), zC (close), zO (open)  : All folding levels

Throughout the file:
zm increases the foldlevel by one.
zM closes all open folds.
zr decreases the foldlevel by one.
zR decreases the foldlevel to zero -- all folds will be open.

[z move tho start of open fold.
]z move to end of open fold.
-----------------------------------------

:set expandtab      -> To insert space characters whenever the tab key is pressed
:set tabstop=4      ->
:set shiftwidth=4   -> To change the number of space characters inserted for indentation
set number
set relativenumber
set autoindent

highlight DiffAdd    cterm=bold ctermfg=10 ctermbg=17 gui=none guifg=bg guibg=Red
highlight DiffDelete cterm=bold ctermfg=10 ctermbg=17 gui=none guifg=bg guibg=Red

highlight DiffText   cterm=bold ctermfg=10 ctermbg=88 gui=none guifg=bg guibg=Red

Sometimes vimdiff screws up the color scheme. The best way to fix it is to enter
:highlight while inside vim. Then copy the values of the combination which looks good.
----  highlight trailing whitespaces.
If your goal is to:
    highlight trailing whitespace in red
    have this highlighting not appear whilst you are typing in insert mode
    have the highlighting of whitespace apply when you open new buffers
then the following 6 commands are what you should put into your .vimrc.

highlight ExtraWhitespace ctermbg=red guibg=red
match ExtraWhitespace /\s\+$/
autocmd BufWinEnter * match ExtraWhitespace /\s\+$/
autocmd InsertEnter * match ExtraWhitespace /\s\+\%#\@<!$/
autocmd InsertLeave * match ExtraWhitespace /\s\+$/
autocmd BufWinLeave * call clearmatches()

:set autoindent
:map <F7> :tabp<CR>

CTRL-b ?   --> Help
CTRL-b z   --> Go fullscreen, Hit CTRL-b z again to shrink it back.
C-b C-<arrow key>: Resize pane in direction of <arrow key>  --> "This is an interesting one. Yes, you need Ctrl in your prefix and also your command key. I find it easiest to only release the b key after the prefix key and keep Ctrl pressed all the time while I hit the arrow key repeatedly."
CTRL-b space-bar  -> change the orientation of panes from horizontal to vertical and vice-versa
CTRL-b %  -> Split into two panes, vertically
CTRL-b "  -> Split into two panes, horizontally

Navigating between panes:
CTRL-b <arrow-keys>  or CTRL-B   --> Rotate between panes
CTRL-d or exit --> close a window or pane


-- Windows --
CTRL-b c  --> Create a new window
CTRL-b p --> switch to previous window
CTRL-b n --> switch to next window
