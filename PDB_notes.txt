Starting the Debugger
	From the Command Line		python -m pdb pdb_script.py
	Within the Interpreter		import pdb; pdb.run(pdb_script.py)
	From Within Your Program 	pdb.set_trace()
	After a Failure			pm() or post_mortem()

Controlling the Debugger
	Navigating the Execution Stack 	<> <where> 
		list 10, 45 	print lines from line number 10 to 45
		where 		find out exactly what line is being executed and where on the call stack you are
		up 		moves towards older frames on the stack
		down		moves towards newer frames
	
	Examining Variables on the Stack
		args	prints all of the arguments to the function active in the current frame
		pp	pretty print
	
	Stepping Through Your Program
		step 	
		next 	step over any function call
		untill	until can be used to step past the end of a loop
		return 	continues executing until the function is about to execute a return statement, and then it pauses
		jump lineno

Breakpoints
	break 		list all the breakpoints currently set
	break lineno	To set a breakpoint on a specific line of the current file, use break lineno
	continue	keep running your program until the next breakpoint		
	To specify a breakpoint in another file, prefix the line or function argument with a filename.	
	disable breakpoint_number
	enable 	breakpoint_number
	clear 	breakpoint_number
	tbreak linenumber  set a temporary breakpoint at linenumber

Conditional Breakpoints	
	break 	breakpoint_number, condition

Ignoring Breakpoints
	ignore	breakpoint_number, this_many_times

Triggering Actions on a Breakpoint
	commands breakpoint_number
