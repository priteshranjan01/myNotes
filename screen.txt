With this screen logging, you don't need to write down every single command that
you have done. To activate screen logging function, just press 'Ctrl-A' and 'H'.
(Please be careful, we use capital 'H' letter. Using non capital 'h', will only
create a screenshot of screen in another file named hardcopy).

At the bottom left of the screen, there will be a notification that tells you
like: Creating logfile 'screenlog.0'.
You will find screenlog.0 file in your home directory.

This feature will append everything you do while you are in the screen window.
To close screen to log running activity, press 'Ctrl-A' and 'H' again.
