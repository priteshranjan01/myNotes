AngularJS is a JavaScript framework. It can be added to an HTML page with a <script> tag.

AngularJS extends HTML attributes with Directives, and binds data to HTML with Expressions.

AngularJS extends HTML with ng-directives.
The ng-app directive defines an AngularJS application.
The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.
The ng-bind directive binds application data to the HTML view.
The ng-repeat directive repeats an HTML element. The ng-repeat directive actually clones HTML elements once for each item in a collection.

AngularJS expressions are written inside double braces: {{ expression }}.
AngularJS will "output" data exactly where the expression is written:

AngularJS modules define AngularJS applications.
AngularJS controllers control AngularJS applications.

The ng-app directive defines the application, the ng-controller directive defines the controller.
When naming a directive, you must use a camel case name, w3TestDirective, but when invoking it, you must use - separated name, w3-test-directive

An AngularJS module defines an application.

The module is a container for the different parts of an application.

The module is a container for the application controllers.

Controllers always belong to a module.

A module is created by using the AngularJS function angular.module

If we consider an AngularJS application to consist of:
    View, which is the HTML.
    Model, which is the data available for the current view.
    Controller, which is the JavaScript function that makes/changes/removes/controls the data.
Then the scope is the Model.
The scope is a JavaScript object with properties and methods, which are available for both the view and the controller.
