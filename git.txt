GIT Configuration:
    System level: git config --system
    user level: git config --global
    project level: git config
    
    git config --global user.name "pritesh ranjan"
    git config --global user.email "priteshranjantrivedi@gmail.com"
    git config --list
    git config user.email
    git config --global core.editor "vim"
    git config --global color.ui true

GIT Auto-Completion: Look on web, how to configure in linux. Already available in windows
Initializing a repository:
git init 
git add  # Have to do this every time, before a commit
git commint -m "first commit"  # Always write commit message in present tense
git commit -a -m "Commits by taking a shortcutting git stage step. Don't use this"  
git status
git log  
git log -n 2  # returns the 2 latest commits
git log --since=2016-01-10
git log --until=2016-01-10
git log --author="pritesh"
git log --grep="initial"

head information in ./.git/HEAD which refers to ./.git/refs/heads/master
View the changes in the working directory:
git diff 
git diff filename
git diff --color-words filename  # nice word by word diffs
view the changes in the staging area:
git diff --staged   (--cached in versions earlier than v1.6, also available in newer version)

Deleting files:
STEP_1> git rm filename.txt  # this will completely delete the file and add that to the staging area/index
git 
STEP_2> git commit -m "i will find you and i will kill you"

Moving and renaming files:
git mv abc.txt def.txt
git commit -m "good luck"  # NOTE: if you delete/move the file directly using OS, then stage them yourself. 

Undoing working directory changes:
git checkout -- filename or directoryname  # -- makes sure that you are checking out files and/or directories in THE CURRENT BRANCH. It's helpful when some filename and directoryname are same as a branch.

Unstaging files:
git reset HEAD filename  

Amending commits:
Can only change the latest commit (for obvious reasons - because there are no other commits that refer to this).
git commit --amend -m "new message"

Retrieving old versions:
git checkout SHA_of_the_commit -- filename  # -- for current branch

Reverting a commit:
git revert revert SHA_of_the_commit_that_is_to_be_reverted  # This will automatically commit the change also. use -n (--no-commit) if you want to commit yourself. 
REMEMBER : revert is good only when changes are simple. Use merge for complex changes.

Using Reset to undo commits: (it's dangerous)
REMEMBER : Keep a copy of all the commit SHA in a separate file, before you fire a reset command. Because after a reset SHA after that reset commit are not sho
Reset moves the HEAD pointer back in the commit chain. If you do any changes it shall override the other commits that had been done after that particular commi
* Soft reset: Just moves the HEAD, but doesn't change the staging index or working directory.
* mixed (default) reset: changes staging index to match repository. Doesn't change working directory.
* hard reset: changes staging index and working directory to match directory.

git reset --soft SHA_of_the_commit_to_which_you_want_to_reset
git reset --mixed SHA_of_the_commit_to_which_you_want_to_reset
git reset --hard SHA_of_the_commit_to_which_you_want_to_reset

Removing untracked files: (other than just deleting them directly from OS.) NOTE: On windows, it wouldn't even go in recycle bin. It will be totally trashed. 
* git clean -f  # give -n option to see what all files will be deleted.

Ignoring files in our project repository
.gitignore
* very basic regular expressions
    e.g. [aeiou][0-9]
    *.php
* negate expressions with !
    !index.php
* # starts a comment
log/*.log 
log/*.log.[0-9]
==> It's a good idea to ignore these type of files: Compiled source code, Zipped Files, Logs and DB files, OS generated files, user-uploaded assets

Ignoring files globally
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global

Ignoring tracked files: 
$> git rm --cached filename
$> git commit -m ""

Tracking empty directory: Well you can't :P But if you really want to, then keep a tiny file and name it ".gitkeep". This name (gitkeep) is just a convention. 
If you are a narcissist, then name it after yourself.

Navigating the commit tree
* parent commit 
    (HEAD^) or (SHA_of_the_commit^) OR (master^) OR (HEAD~) OR (HEAD~1)
*grandparent commit
    (HEAD^^) or (SHA_of_the_commit^^) OR (master^^) OR (HEAD~2)
* great-grandparent commit
    (HEAD^^^) or (SHA_of_the_commit^^^) OR (master^^^) or (HEAD~3)

exploring tree listings : 
$> git ls-tree HEAD  # google for further information 

Getting more info from the commit log: 
$> git log --oneline
$> git log --oneline -4
$> git log -p 
$> git log -p filename
$> git log filename
$> git log --stat --summary
$> git log --format=oneline
$> git log -n 4 --format=email
$> git log -n 4 --format=short
$> git log -n 4 --format=medium
$> git log -n 4 --format=full
$> git log -n 4 --format=fuller
$> git log --oneline --graph --all --decorate

Viewing commits: 
$> git show SHA_of_the_commit
$> git show --oneline HEAD
$> git show --oneline HEAD~3  #Show the third last commit

Comparing commits: 
$> git diff SHA_of_the_commit_with_which_current_working_directory_state_is_to_compared
$> git diff SHA filename
$> git log SHA_of_the_first_commit SHA_of_the_second_commit 
$> git diff --ignore-space_change SHA_of_the_first_commit..HEAD  # or use -b instead of '--ignore-space_change'
--ignore-all-space or just -w


GIT Branching:
$> git branch  # this will list all the branches currently present
$> git branch new_branch  # create another branch called 'new_branch'
$> git branch -r  # lists all the remote branches
$> git branch -a  # lists all the branches
$> git checkout new_branch  # switch to new_branch
$> git checkout new_branch_name -b  # Create a new branch,  check that out and switch to it 

Comparing branching: 
$> git diff branch_1..branch_2  # the order of names doesn't matter
$> git branch --merged  # Tells which branch has all the commits. # Google for more info

Renaming branches: 
$> git branch --move old_branch_name new_branch_name  # -m instead of --move will be fine too

Deleting branches: 
$> git branch --delete name_of_branch  # -d will work in place of --delete  # If there are non-merged changes, then it will fail. 
$> git branch -D name_of_branch  # This is not a request, it's an order. Delete this branch. Non-merged changes will be lost.

Configuring the command prompt to show the branch:  Google about this 

Merging Code:
-->> The first step is that we want to make sure that we checkout the branch that things are being merged into, the receiver.
$> git checkout master
$> git merge new_branch
$> git merge --no-ff branch_name  # Don't merge the branches silently, make a commit and let it show in git logs 
$> git merge --ff-only branch_name  # DO merging only if you can do a fast- forward merge

Resolving conflicts: The thing that gives me a migraine
These are your options:
1) Abort the merge: $> git merge --abort
2) Resolve the conflicts manually (Sorry to say, but this is what I do most of the time), stage the changes and commit
3) Use a merge tool: Google about this

Stashing Changes: 
$> git stash save   "a message to remind you of the changes"
$> git stash list  # lists all the stash list
$> git stash show stash@{0}  # show the stash number 0 
$> git stash show -p stash@{1}  # Show the stash number 1 in diff (patch) style
$> git stash apply stash@{0}  # Merges the changes the stash in the current branch. NOTE: You can move the stash of one branch to another. CAUTION: This can lead to conflicts and hence headaches.
$> git stash pop stash@{0}  # merges the changes and makes the changes into the working directory also
$> git stash drop stash@{0}  # Discard the data in the stash # 0
$> git stash clear  # Drops all of the stashes

Remote branches:
$> git remote  # lists all the remote branches that is known to this repository
$> git remote add origin https://github.com/priteshranjan01/myNotes.git
$> git remote -v 
$> git remote rm alias_of_the_remote_repository  # eg. of alias is 'origin'
 Creating a remote branch:
 $> git push -u origin master
 View the contents of .git/config
 
 Cloning a remote repository:
 $> git clone https://github.com/priteshranjan01/myNotes.git name_of_the_directory_in_which_to_store_files
 NOTE: if you want to checkout a particular branch, give '-b' option with 'git clone'
 Tracking remote branches: Google it, I am in a hurry.
 
 Pushing changes to the remote repository:
 $> git push  # pushes to the default branches that is being tracked
 
 Fetching changes from a remote repository:
 $> git fetch origin 
 GOLDEN TIPS : 
 -- Start your day with a git fetch
 -- fetch before you push
 -- fetch often
